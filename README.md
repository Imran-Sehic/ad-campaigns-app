## Ad Campaign App

This is the root project for the Ad Campaign App from where you can start both the frontend and the backend.

You can start both the frontend and backend running in a docker container. More info on the docker setup in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

Running from this folder the following command in the terminal `docker-compose up` will start the docker container and expose the application at the port `3000`.
